# Crosshair Customization Guide

To customize your crosshair, follow these steps:

1. **Choose a random crosshair** from the web and download it to this folder.  
   - Name the file `crosshair`.  
   - **Important**: Delete the default crosshair, but remember, the default one is better.

2. **Open the script files**:
   - Open `convert.py` and `change_setting.py`.
   - Choose your desired size and color for the crosshair.

3. **Start the script**:
   - Run the script using `crosshair.py`.

That's it! Once you run the script, your new crosshair should be set up and ready to use.  

Hope this helps you improve your aim!
